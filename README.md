How does one know if they are living in a democracy?  Some countries may have laws and elections
that make them look like a democracy, but in practice may operate as an authoritarian regime?
Figuring out if you are living in an authoritarian state can involve more than just reading
what the constitution and laws say, but paying attention to what is actually going on.
Use this game as an indicator to see how democratic your country currently is.

This game consists of a page of instructions and a bingo card.  The instructions explain each of
the labels listed on the bingo card.  Each of the labels corresponds to a very anti-democratic action.
The bingo.tex latex file can be used to generate a random card.
Otherwise simply use one of the premade bingo cards.

When the leader of your country does something that is not normally done in a democracy,
you may be able to mark one of the bingo squares.  No action should cover more than one square.
If more than one criteria is met, choose the more specific rule.

What would a good citizen do if they got a bingo?

Alternatively, for even more fun, you can take a historical leader, and see if the leader would have given
you a bingo on your card.
